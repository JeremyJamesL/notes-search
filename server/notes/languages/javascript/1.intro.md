# Introduction to Javascript

You can pass types to JS functions by declaring the type in the function params like so:

```ts
function doMath(num: number) {
  return num * num;
}

function greet(greeting: string, name: string) {
  return `${greeting}, my name is ${name}`;
}
```

> If you don't define a parameter type, it will default to 'any'

### Default function params

You can pass defaults as well.

```ts
function newGreeting(greet: string = "hello world") {
  return greet;
}
```

`newGreet()` will return "hello world", whereas `newGreet("Goodbye cruel world")` will obviously return "goodbye cruel world".

## Function return params

Like variable declarataions, TS infers types returned from functions.

```ts
function inferType(num: number) {
  return num * num;
}

inferType(20);
```

TS will infer that return type is `number`, but you can also pass it after the function params like so:

```ts
function inferType(num: number): number {
  return num * num;
}

inferType(20);
```

TS will yell at you if you don't return a number in the above function, so it helps with dev experience and sanity.

## Anonymous functions

TS will infer type from anonymous functions, like `maps` and `forEach` loops:

```ts
const colours = ["red", "black", "blue"];

colours.map((el) => {
  return el.toLocaleUpperCase();
});
```

it's inferred that the return statement here is for a `string`.

## Functions that don't return anything / void

For functions that don't return anything, TS infers type:

```ts
function printTwice(msg: string) {
  console.log(msg);
  console.log(msg);
}
```

TS will infer `printTwice` as returning `void`. You can also declare this as a type:

```ts
function printTwice(msg: string): void {
  console.log(msg);
  console.log(msg);
}
```

## Never return

The `never` type tells TS that the function should never return anything.

It's different to void, which returns nothing, because it never returns. A use case could be a function that might just throw an error, or loops infinitely:

```ts
function gameLoop() {
  while (true) {
    console.log("GAME LOG");
  }
}
```
