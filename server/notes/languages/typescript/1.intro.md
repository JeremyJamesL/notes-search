# Typescript

## Basics

Typescript is a superset of Javascript, meaning it is built ontop of Javascript and provides added functionality ontop of the language

The reason for this is that JS wasn't written to be used as widely as it is today, and therefore it has bugs and quirks.

For example we can do the following in JS:

```js
const dims = {
  height: 20,
  width: 1000,
};

console.log(dims.hieght);
```

This doesn't throw an error in JS. Other languages are strongly typed and would throw an error for this mispelling.

## Adding JS types

Typescript adds Types to Javascript. It allows you as a developer to declare a variable, function argument etc as a type and any variable assignment that doesn't match the declared type, will throw an error.

Typescript will still compile erronenous TS code to JS, but it throws errors and exceptions in the IDE to make your development life easier.m

For e.g

```js
Math.round("Hello world");
```

Math.round expect a number, not a string, TS will throw an error here.

```js
const myString: string = 400;
```

This will throw an error as you can't assign a number to a type `string`.
